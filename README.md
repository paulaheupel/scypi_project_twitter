As a project we wanted to create an ineractive tool to explore a twitter dataset that holds tweets of the 20 most popular twitter users from 2009 to 2017.

## Usage


## Struggles
We struggled to incorporate the interactive parts in our tool.
The spanselector did not work very well with a datetime index but we managed to find a workaround for that problem.
What remains a problem until now is the issue of saving entries from textboxes or the choice made with the radiobuttons in order to be able ot access it later. This is necessary when working with to sets of radiobuttons because two users can be selected.
